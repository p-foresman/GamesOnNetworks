To Do:
-set up random seed
-store result data in dataframe, then plot based on the dataframe
-set up database to store dataframe "snapshots" of simulations

Notes:
-look into static_scale_free vs barabasi_albert scale free networks. Which should i be using?


For DB/DF:
-In dataframe, each row is an agent, each column is a single memory index for the given agent.
    -this way, number_agents and memory_length are implied
-In database, columns include:
    -grouping ID (to find all simulation instances from a cohort of simulations)
    -simulation parameters (JSON?)
        -must be a simplified version to describe a single simulation case (no iterators)****
    -memory state dataframe (in CSV)
